GPT Name: Py-Assistant
System Prompt: "
py-assistant is a helpful App that can assist you in writing code and teach you Python knowledge through a chatbased Q&A format. Whether you need guidance on writing an abstract class, defining a decorator, creating a
dictionary application with a UI, or even fixing code, py-assistant is there to help. With a friendly ‘Hello’ in its
welcome message, this App is designed to make learning Python fun and interactive. With access to Python tools
and a browser, py-assistant is your go-to companion for all your Python needs.
"
Example prompts
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Prompt 1: “How do I write an abstract class?”
Prompt 2: “Can you define a decorator for me?”
Prompt 3: “I need help with creating a dictionary application with a user interface.”
Prompt 4: “Can you explain this code to me?”
Prompt 5: “I have some code that needs fixing, can you help?”

Features and commands
1. Write an abstract class: To write an abstract class, you can use the following syntax:
class AbstractClass:
def __init__(self):
# Constructor code goes here
pass
def abstract_method(self, param1, param2):
raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
Replace AbstractClass with the name of your class and abstract_method with the name of your
abstract method. Remember to raise a NotImplementedError within the abstract method to enforce
subclasses to implement it.
2. Define a decorator: To define a decorator function, you can use the following syntax:
def decorator_function(original_function):
def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
# Code to be executed before the original function
print("Before the function")
result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
# Code to be executed after the original function
print("After the function")
return result
return wrapper_function
Replace decorator_function with the name of your decorator function, wrapper_function with the
name of the wrapper function, and customize the code to be executed before and after the original function as
needed.
3. Create a dictionary application with UI: To create a dictionary application with a user interface, you can use

a library like Tkinter or PyQt to build the UI. Here’s an example using Tkinter:
import tkinter as tk
def search_dictionary():
# Code to search the dictionary
# and display the results in the UI
def add_word():
# Code to add a word to the dictionary
def delete_word():
# Code to delete a word from the dictionary
# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()
# Create UI components (labels, buttons, entry fields, etc.)
search_label = tk.Label(window, text="Search:")
search_entry = tk.Entry(window)
search_button = tk.Button(window, text="Search", command=search_dictionary)
add_label = tk.Label(window, text="Add:")
add_entry = tk.Entry(window)
add_button = tk.Button(window, text="Add", command=add_word)
delete_label = tk.Label(window, text="Delete:")
delete_entry = tk.Entry(window)
delete_button = tk.Button(window, text="Delete", command=delete_word)
# Layout the UI components
search_label.grid(row=0, column=0)
search_entry.grid(row=0, column=1)
search_button.grid(row=0, column=2)
add_label.grid(row=1, column=0)
add_entry.grid(row=1, column=1)
add_button.grid(row=1, column=2)
delete_label.grid(row=2, column=0)
delete_entry.grid(row=2, column=1)
delete_button.grid(row=2, column=2)
# Start the main event loop
window.mainloop()
Customize the code inside the search_dictionary(), add_word(), and delete_word() functions to
implement the desired dictionary functionality.
4. Explain the code: To get an explanation of a code snippet, you can provide the code as input and ask for
clarification or specific details. For example:
"Can you explain this code to me?"
code = """
def multiply(a, b):
return a * b

result = multiply(3, 4)
print(result)
"""
The assistant will then provide an explanation or answer any specific questions you have about the code.
5. Fix the code: To get help with fixing code, you can provide the code as input and ask for assistance. For
example:
"I have some code that needs fixing, can you help?"
code = """
def greet(name)
print("Hello, " + name)
greet("Alice")
"""
The assistant will then help identify and suggest corrections for any syntax or logical errors in the code.

write:
my_array.each do |element|
puts element
end
This will print each element of the array on a new line.
2. Ruby symbols: In Ruby, symbols are a way to represent names or strings as immutable identifiers. They are
commonly used as keys in hashes or as method names. To define a symbol, use a colon before the symbol
name, like :my_symbol. Here’s an example of using a symbol as a hash key:
my_hash = { :name => "John", :age => 30 }
In this example, :name and :age are symbols used as keys in the my_hash hash.
3. Ruby gems: Ruby gems are packages or libraries written in Ruby that provide additional functionality to your
Ruby programs. Some popular Ruby gems include rails for web development, rspec for testing, and
devise for authentication. To install a Ruby gem, you can use the gem install command followed by the
gem name. For example, to install the rails gem, you can run:
gem install rails
4. Debugging Ruby code: There are several ways to debug Ruby code. One common method is to use puts
statements to print values and debug information at different points in your code. Another method is to use the
binding.pry statement to set breakpoints and inspect variables interactively. You can also use the raise
keyword to raise an exception and pause the program execution at a specific point. Additionally, there are
debugging tools and IDEs available that provide more advanced debugging features.
