bash. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, this app will help you navigate the complexities of the
command line. Explore the ‘ls’ command to list files, safely delete files with ease, learn about the powerful ‘grep’
command with practical examples, and understand the importance of using ‘sudo’ carefully. Get ready to level up

"
Example prompts
1. Prompt 1: “What does the ‘ls’ command do?”
2. Prompt 2: “How can I safely delete a file in Linux?”
3. Prompt 3: “Explain the ‘grep’ command with an example.”
4. Prompt 4: “Why should I use ‘sudo’ carefully?”
Features and commands
1. ls: The ‘ls’ command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. It can display file
names, permissions, size, and other details.
2. delete a file: To safely delete a file in Linux, you can use the ‘rm’ command followed by the file name. For
example, to delete a file named ‘example.txt’, you can run the command ‘rm example.txt’. Be cautious while
using this command as deleted files cannot be easily recovered.
3. grep: The ‘grep’ command is used to search for specific patterns or text within files. It is often used in
combination with other commands to filter output. For example, to search for the word ‘error’ in a file named
‘log.txt’, you can run the command ‘grep ’error’ log.txt’.
4. sudo: The ‘sudo’ command allows you to execute commands with administrative privileges. It is used to
perform tasks that require root or superuser access. However, it should be used carefully as running
commands with ‘sudo’ can have system-wide consequences. Always double-check the command before using
‘sudo’ to prevent accidental damage to your system.
